# Explain
- In this example, firts import the class "Stack" of pack "java.util
- Next we creart a new object "Stack" name stack for using the constructor default
- Push 4 integers to piles use the method "push"
- That we extract the elements of the piles using the method "pop()" on loop While
- The method isEmpty() is used for verified if the piles is empty before try extract a element
- This code create a piles of integers and put 4 integers in the piles in the order 1->2->3->4.
- Next we extract the elements of the piles one by one use the method "pop()", that eliminate and come back the top element of the pile
- Since the stack follows a last-in-first-out (LIFO), the elements is extract in the order inverser of the insert, so give how result in the output shown above
